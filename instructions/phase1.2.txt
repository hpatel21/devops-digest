Implement the full PR tracking feature:

1. Create a function `get_my_pull_requests()` that:
   - Searches for PRs where I'm the author: `author:USERNAME is:open is:pr`
   - Searches for PRs I'm reviewing: `review-requested:USERNAME is:open is:pr`
   - Searches for PRs where I'm mentioned: `mentions:USERNAME is:open is:pr`
   - Combines results and removes duplicates
   - Calculates age in days from creation date
   - Groups them into: "My PRs", "Reviewing", "Mentioned"

2. Add a `--prs` flag that displays the results in a nice formatted way in the terminal

3. Make sure each PR shows:
   - Repository name
   - PR title and number
   - Age in days
   - Clickable URL

Test it after you're done so I can see the output.
