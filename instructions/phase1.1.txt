I want to build a CLI tool called "devops-digest" that generates daily reports. Here's what I need:

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- Create a new Python project with proper structure
- Use `click` for CLI framework
- Use `requests` for API calls
- Use environment variables for GitHub token

INITIAL FILES NEEDED:
1. devops-digest.py - main entry point
2. requirements.txt - dependencies
3. .gitignore - standard Python gitignore
4. README.md - basic usage instructions
5. reports/ - directory for generated reports

FIRST FEATURE - GitHub PR Tracker:
Create a function that:
1. Reads GITHUB_TOKEN from environment
2. Gets my GitHub username from the token
3. Queries GitHub API for all open PRs where I'm involved (author, reviewer, or mentioned)
4. Returns structured data with: repo name, PR title, PR number, age in days, URL

Keep it simple for now - just focus on getting the GitHub API integration working correctly.

Start by creating the project structure and the basic CLI skeleton with a --test flag that verifies the GitHub token works.
