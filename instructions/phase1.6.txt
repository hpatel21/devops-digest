Let's add some polish:

1. Add a summary at the end showing:
   - Total execution time
   - APIs called
   - Any errors encountered

2. Add colors to terminal output using click.secho

3. Create a simple test that verifies the GitHub token has the right permissions

4. Update the README with:
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Sample output screenshot (in text)

5. Test the full workflow end-to-end and generate a sample report
