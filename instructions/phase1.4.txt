Add stale branch detection:

1. Create function `get_stale_branches()` that:
   - Gets all my repositories
   - For each repo, list all branches
   - Exclude: main, master, develop, production
   - Check last commit date on each branch
   - Flag branches older than 30 days
   - Collect: repo name, branch name, age, last commit author

2. Add a `--stale` flag to display stale branches

3. Sort by age (oldest first)

Test it after implementation.
