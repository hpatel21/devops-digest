Now tie it all together with report generation:

1. Create function `generate_report()` that:
   - Calls all three functions (PRs, builds, stale branches)
   - Formats everything into a markdown file
   - Uses template from the PRD above
   - Includes summary stats at the top
   - Saves to ./reports/devops-digest-YYYY-MM-DD.md

2. Make the default command (no flags) generate and save the full report

3. Add a `--view` flag that also opens the report in the default markdown viewer

4. Add proper error handling for API failures

5. Show a progress indicator while fetching data

Run it and show me the generated report!
