Add failed build tracking:

1. Create a function `get_failed_builds()` that:
   - Gets all repositories I have access to
   - For each repo, check GitHub Actions runs from last 12 hours
   - Filter for: conclusion == "failure" (exclude cancelled)
   - Collect: repo name, workflow name, branch, failure time, run URL

2. Add a `--builds` flag to display failed builds

3. Show timestamp in relative format (e.g., "2 hours ago")

Test it after implementation.
